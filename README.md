**Dentogram** is an android app which helps the doctors maintain records of the medical history, medicines, treatments, bills, allergies of their patients individually. The application allows the doctor to make notes about their meetings with the patient which can include information like their next appointment date along with the medicine list as well as the prescription. The app also allows the doctor to upload images of the prescription. Usually as the patient keeps a hardcopy record of these things, the doctor can save and share the patient details as a PDF file. All the data is backed up on cloud which enables the Doctors to access it through multiple devices and changes made on one device will also refect to the data in the other devices.



# Installing the App

 Download the .apk file and install it in your android device.
 
**Dentogram** requires the doctor to create an account on the application for using the specified features. Make sure that you are connected to the internet, if you are not then the app will display the "No Internet Connection" bar and will give you an option to connect the Internet.
